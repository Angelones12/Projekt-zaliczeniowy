## Introduction
This project is designed for learning ML and streamlit.

The result of this project is a web app consisting of a machine learning module, database, and a visual interface.

Project features include:
- Detecting dog breeds using photos.
- Adding dogs with their picture, breed, and curiosity to the database.
- Learning about dogs with a list of their breeds, curiosities, and photos.

## Technologies

This project was made with:

- ![MySQL](images/mysql.png) **MySQL**: 8.3.0
- ![Python](images/python.png) **Python**: 3.9
- ![Streamlit](images/streamlit.png) **Streamlit**: 1.33.0

## Setup guide

### Prerequisites

To install this software and be able to run it, you need to install packages from requirements.txt and run mysql server

### Installing the Application 

After you clone the repository, you need to run the terminal and go to the directory `\Dockerized\app`, which contains all the files.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Introduction to Machine Learning Content
This section of the documentation explains how Machine Learning (ML) system works. The primary purpose of this ML model is to detect dog breeds from photos uploaded by users through a Streamlit app.

## Machine Learning Technologies 
The project is based on:
- ![PyTorch](images/pytorch2.png) **PyTorch**: 2.3.1

For visual detection, we have used the ResNet50 architecture with the Adam optimizer.
## Machine Learning Setup Guide
To run the ML model, follow these steps:
1. **Download and Install CUDA Drivers and NVIDIA Toolkit** First, download and install the CUDA drivers version 12.1 and the NVIDIA Toolkit. You can download them from the following link: [CUDA 12.1.0 Download Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)
2. **Install PyTorch** 
After installing the necessary drivers and toolkit, you need to install PyTorch. You can follow the instructions on the [PyTorch Get Started page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), or use one of the following commands:
For pip users:
``pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121``
For anaconda users:
``conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia``

3. **Install packages** Later on it is required to download packages from requirement.txt from the section "#ML"
4. **Running Python file**
In the terminal move to the "model" folder and run:
``
python ml.py
``
## Dataset Description
The dataset used to create this project was "Stanford Dogs Dataset" it can be found here: [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. Contents of this dataset:

-   **Number of categories:**  120
-   **Number of images:**  20,580
-   **Annotations:**  Class labels, Bounding boxes

Description of dataset was copied from original site.

## Machine Learning Metrics

### Overall Metrics:
The best validation loss is tracked to save the best model.
Metrics for each epoch (training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, and validation accuracy) are stored in the history dictionary [here](Dockerized/app/model/metrics/metrics.txt).


- val_loss: 0.5249379908254896
- val_accuracy: 0.9699663623258049


## Training History
### Training Phase Metrics:
Training Loss:

For each batch of training data, the model computes the outputs and the corresponding loss using the CrossEntropyLoss criterion.
The loss is accumulated over all batches to calculate the average training loss for the epoch.
Formula: epoch_loss = running_loss / len(train_loader.dataset)

Training Accuracy:

The top-3 predicted classes for each input are compared with the actual labels.
Correct predictions are those where the actual label is within the top-3 predictions.
The number of correct predictions is divided by the total number of samples to get the accuracy.
Formula: epoch_acc = correct / total

### Validation Phase Metrics:
Validation Loss:

Similar to training loss, the validation loss is computed for each batch and accumulated.
The average validation loss for the epoch is calculated.
Formula: val_loss = running_val_loss / len(val_loader.dataset)

Validation Accuracy:
The top-3 predicted classes are used to compute the accuracy, similar to the training phase.
Formula: val_acc = correct / total
